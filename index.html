    <h3> What was the goal for Jam For Cam?</h3>

<p>Jam for Cam is a non-for-profit founded in honor of the late Cameron Fearon, who passed away from metastasized melanoma cancer. The goal of Jam for Cam was to create and host a philanthropy concert in honor of Cameron, and through this process raise as much money as possible for <em>Melanoma Research Foundation</em>. Personally, I was a close friend of Cameron in high school as well as his fraternity brother at UGA, and so this event held a special place in my heart. He lived life to the fullest and set an example of joy for everyone around him. The idea for a battle of the bands concert was one Cameron had before he passed, so a few of us as his friends decided what better way to honor him than to host that same event in his honor. Our mission was to raise over 30,000 dollars and we were able to blow away this goal.</p>

<h3>What was the event / How did it go?</h3>

<p>The event was a 4 band concert on November 9th that sold over <span style ="text-decoration: underline">7000 tickets.</span> Leading up to the event we had several percentage nights and social events were a portion of funds went straight towards the donations pool. In the end, we raised over <strong>40,000 dollars</strong> and will have a large portion to donate to Melanoma Research Foundation, as well as a fund to help host the Second Annual Jam for Cam the following year.</p>

<h2>Red and Black</h2>
    <p>Jam for Cam was spoken of inside of an article written by the Red and Black Newspaper at UGA, an excerpt from the article is as follows:</p> 
    
    <blockquote cite ="https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/sigma-nu-jam-for-cam-raises-more-than-in-memory/article_366237f2-e50e-11e8-b3fe-876dc455d100.html"> <p>The local bands that participated were Himalayan Pool Party, Underground Springhouse, Jester and AFTM. The crowd jammed out to a range of their original music, along with some covers such as Kung Fu Fighting. Before the event opened its doors, the fraternity sold more than 5,400 wristbands. Carson Seramur, a member of Sigma Nu, knew Fearon since high school through basketball and was in the same pledge class. Seramur attributes the event becoming a reality to fellow brothers Matthew Brown and Colin Beecham. Beecham, close friend of Fearon, spearheaded Jam for Cam. Their original goal was to raise 20,000 dollars. Their gross funds before the night started was exactly 50,377.70 dollars as a result of tickets and their fundraiser on GoFundMe, an amount higher than they expected. He expects more than 40,000 dollars will be donated to the camp and charities.</p>
